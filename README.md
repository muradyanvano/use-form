# Form hooks

Typed React form state for nested fields, field arrays, files, validation, and submission. This repository also hosts a Vite demo application and Storybook workspace.

## Release-readiness status

Local packaging is in place: ESM library build, declaration files, package `exports`, peer React, archive checks, and consumer tests.

**Not published.** Do not treat the current `package.json` `name` (`react-hooks`) as a public npm identity. It is a generic workspace name.

Release blockers that the owner must resolve before publishing:

- Final npm package name/scope required before publishing.
- License selection required before public release.
- Repository, homepage, bugs, and author metadata are unset.
- CI provider is not established.
- `private: true` remains set so an accidental `npm publish` is blocked.

## Features

- Strongly typed values, nested paths, and one level of field arrays
- Granular subscriptions (`useWatch`, `useFormState`, `useFieldState`)
- Native `register()` and headless `useController`
- File fields without reading contents into form state
- Built-in rules, custom rules, async debounce, resolvers, and i18n catalogs
- Async default-value loading and conditional `unregister`
- Structured errors (`FieldError` + string view)
- Non-reactive getters and atomic `form.batch()`
- Development-only DevTools on a separate entry

## Installation

The package is not on npm yet. After a public name is chosen:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

Peer requirement: **React 19**. `react-dom` is an optional peer (needed for SSR tests and DOM rendering). React Native is not tested.

Until publish, develop from this repository with `npm ci` (preferred) or `npm install` at the root.

Supported tooling (also declared in `package.json` `engines`): **Node** `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`, **npm** `>=10`. Use the committed `package-lock.json`; do not omit the lockfile for installs.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { rules, useForm, ValidationMode } from '<package-name>'

function Login() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: { email: '', password: '' },
    mode: ValidationMode.OnSubmit,
    rules: {
      email: [rules.required(), rules.email()],
      password: [rules.required(), rules.minLength(8)],
    },
    onSubmit: (values) => {
      void values
    },
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit} noValidate>
      <input {...form.register('email')} />
      <input {...form.register('password')} type="password" />
      <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Form hooks and components are **client-side APIs**. In React Server Component frameworks, import them from a Client Component (`'use client'`). The Standard Schema adapter does not import React and may be loaded on the server.

### DevTools

```ts
import { FormDevTools } from '<package-name>/devtools'
```

### Standard Schema adapter

```ts
import { standardSchemaResolver } from '<package-name>/resolvers/standard-schema'
```

The adapter is not exported from the core entry. It does not depend on Zod, Yup, or Valibot.
